# Fattest Frog First - Global Game Jam 2025 - Team Marley

## Desc
In this twin-stick bubbler, you're a frog worshipping fairy who wants to feed the healthy bugs to your frog allowing them to grow stronger. But your annoying fairy sibling also has a frog companion they want to feed. Use your bubble wand to capture the limited supply of delicious insects (Apple Aphids, Brussel Bugs, Carrot Critters, and Banana Fruit Flies) to feed your froggy friend before your opponent steals them for their own.

(2-player game, 2 controllers required)

## Controls
Each player gets 2 joysticks:
- One joystick to move
- One joystick to extend and sweep your bubble wand
